# This is sample SDL schema for GraphQL Faker.
#
# There are two directives you can use to enhance fake data:
#   - @fake
#   - @examples
# Each directive has autocompletion working so start by typing @
#
# Press save or Cmd+Enter to apply the changes and update server. Switch to GraphiQL
# on the left panel to immediately test your changes.
# This tool also supports extending existing APIs. Check graphql-faker --help
